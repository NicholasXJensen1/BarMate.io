            <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
			<p>As Barmate grows as a company, so do the founders. We want to provide others with a better understanding of the founders' backgrounds so you can have a better understanding of our roots as you follow our growth. For this edition we will start with our CEO, Rodney Morgan. Rodney is a fourth year student at the University of Akron seeking a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. From 2012-2016 he worked at Marc Glassman Inc., where he stocked shelves and gained leadership experience through the training of new employees and the coordinating of the closing routine. During his time in college, he’s gained technical knowledge through classes and a student organization that he co-founded named HAkron. HAkron’s purpose is to organize a yearly Hackathon - a 24 hour programming competition, and provide technical programming skills in the form of weekly meetings to students at the University of Akron. Rodney is also a part of Phi Kappa Psi, a philanthropic fraternity on campus. He has held leadership roles of Recruitment Chair and Recording Secretary, and has been a contributing member of the Philanthropy committee. He has had four co-op rotations with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Corp., where he has developed and deployed global applications using C#, SQL, and Apache Flex. He has also utilized Apache Camel to leverage ActiveMQ routing of data from various sources to an IoT Hub. Another project Rodney has worked on is updating outdated websites that were made with insecure Java applets. He worked hard to remove all of these applets and use PHP and Javascript to recreate them. Last small fact about Rodney is that he thoroughly enjoys playing tennis and is always looking for someone to challenge him.</p>

            <h2>Developement & Techology</h2>
            <p>Since BarMate's inception, the technical members of our team have carefully developed the framework for our application to ensure that our product is a result of the pride that we take in our work and the values that we hold in our company. We have spent hours discussing features, design, transitions, animations, and app flow so that our app is scalable, user friendly, and appealing. Careful thought has been taken into data structure to ensure that this app is ready for users on launch date. Furthermore, we’ve ensured that the information that we collect is non-intrusive to users, but also exposes trends about bars that we can use to help bar owners provide experiences that their customers would want the most. So far, we have a functional framework of our app that shows the basic concept of each of the main screens. Currently, we are able to dynamically pull bar data from the Google Places API and use their latitude and longitude coordinates to place them on the map. Also, we can obtain information about each bar that lands on the map such as business hours, names, ratings, expected price range, and more. Currently, our app developers are focused on developing peer to peer messaging and creating our “add bars” component that allows users to add lists of bars that they frequently visit, so they can have them available in a convenient place. We have chosen to develop our application in React Native, a Javascript variant created by Facebook that allows us to write code that runs natively on both Android and iOS. This way, we don’t have to worry about developing two versions of our app in parallel, and can focus on a single, solid user experience.</p>

            <h2>Marketing and Business</h2>
			<p>BarMate is implementing various forms of marketing to reach as many users and bars as possible. Although our efforts thus far have been slow and steady, we are developing and executing physical marketing, digital marketing, and social media marketing campaigns. BarMate will look to focus on the user’s unique experience, and ultimately how BarMate will better their lives through social inteaction. BarMate would like to be known as “The Guide to Going Out” and will reflect that in all marketing platforms. We invite you to follow us on our journey through following us on our social media platforms! </p>
