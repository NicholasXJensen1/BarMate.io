								<p> BarMate is a company started by six (6) young adults. The original idea for BarMate was much like the idea for the telephone where two people had almost the exact same idea at the same time. Two of our co-founders, had this idea that people at bars spend much time thinking about interacting with people and too little time doing so. Two friends in Tallahassee, Florida contacted a long time friend in Akron, Ohio, Rodney Morgan. Rodney assembled the rest of the founding team and when it all became official, five of the six original members were able to move forward with product creation. We now have a sound team around a remarkable product, "The Guide to Going Out!"<div class = "pics">

								BarMate is a company started by six (6) young adults. The original idea for BarMate was much like the idea for the telephone where two people had almost the exact same idea at the same time. Two of our co-founders, Rodney Morgan and Mason Marks, had this idea that people at bars spend much time thinking about interacting with people and too little time doing so. Mason talked to his friend Kevin about this idea and Kevin about this idea. Rodney talked to his friend Riley about this idea. Kevin brought the thought of this location-based social media platorm Rodney and soon the team began to form. Nick and Joe were brought on shortly thereafter and the founding team was formed. Later Nick invited his long time friend, and successful sales and marketing major at the University of Toledo, Jovan into the mix as Director of Sales.
