										<p> BarMate is a company started by six (6) young adults. The original idea for BarMate was much like the idea for the telephone where two people had almost the exact same idea at the same time. Two of our co-founders, had this idea that people at bars spend much time thinking about interacting with people and too little time doing so. Two friends in Tallahassee, Florida contacted a long time friend in Akron, Ohio, Rodney Morgan. Rodney assembled the rest of the founding team and when it all became official, five of the six original members were able to move forward with product creation. We now have a sound team around a remarkable product, "The Guide to Going Out!"<div class = "pics">

										<p> Bar goers seek new and excited places to spend their hard-earned money. People today don’t just go out to drink like those of the previous generations. They search for excitement and adventure to get the most fun experience out of the money they spend. For this reason, new types of bars have been popping up all over the U.S., we call these “specialty bars.” These specialty bars can have a variety of offerings for their patrons including vintage video games, board games, and even shuffleboard! With all these specials, don’t you want to see where it’s all happening? Of course, you do! BarMate will allow you to see all the bars in your area to help you decide for yourself which locations have everything you need to have the best night possible. So, whether you’re going out to a wine bar to relax after a long week or a barcade where you can smash your friends’ high scores in Pac-man, BarMate will help you find it all!
